        <h3>About Bangalore</h3>
        <p>
            Bengaluru (also called Bangalore) is the capital of India's southern Karnataka state. The center of India's
            high-tech
            industry, the city is also known for its parks and nightlife. By Cubbon Park, Vidhana Soudha is a
            Neo-Dravidian
            legislative building. Former royal residences include 19th-century Bangalore Palace, modeled after England’s
            Windsor
            Castle, and Tipu Sultan’s Summer Palace, an 18th-century teak structure.
